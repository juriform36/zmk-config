# nice!view

The nice!view is a low-power, high refresh rate display meant to replace I2C OLEDs traditionally used.

This shield requires that an `&nice_view_spi` labeled SPI bus is provided with _at least_ MOSI, SCK, and CS pins defined.

## Disable custom widget

The nice!view shield includes a custom vertical widget. To use the built-in ZMK one, add the following item to your `.conf` file:

```
CONFIG_ZMK_DISPLAY_STATUS_SCREEN_BUILT_IN=y
CONFIG_ZMK_LV_FONT_DEFAULT_SMALL_MONTSERRAT_26=y
CONFIG_LV_FONT_DEFAULT_MONTSERRAT_26=y
```
